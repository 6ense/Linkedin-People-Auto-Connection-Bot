# Linkedin-People-Auto-Connection-Bot

This bot allows you to automatically grow your network by connecting with 2nd connections. It goes through pages and connects with people, by-passing people that have security settings set to only people they know.

#*************** STEP 1 **************** 
input a session_username and session_password which correspond to your LinkedIn username and password;

#*************** STEP 2 ****************
input the url link to your second connections page in LinkedIn. How to do that, below:
    - enter nothing in the search field and press enter;
    - Click the "People" button;
    - Click the "Connect" button;
    - Select the "Second Connections" option.
    - Copy the URL link


You will see comments with the above annotation in the code which denotes the STEP where you want to input your custom parameters.

Keep in mind that LinkedIn will automatically stop you, when you've attempted to connect to 80-100 users. This connection limit will reset every week.

SPAM RESPONSIBLY.
